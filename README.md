## Overview

### This project is a simple yet effective Movie Recommendation System built using cosine similarity to recommend movies based on user preferences or selected movies. The system is wrapped in an interactive and user-friendly web application built with Streamlit, allowing users to explore and receive recommendations in real-time.

## Features

### 1. Recommends similar movies based on a selected movie using cosine similarity.

### 2. Interactive web app for users to browse and search movies.

### 3. Provides additional details about movies, such as genre, description, and ratings.

### 4. Lightweight and easy to deploy.


### Dataset:   The system uses a dataset containing movie details like titles, genres, and descriptions (e.g., from Kaggle or IMDb datasets).

## Preprocessing:  

### 1. Text data is vectorized using techniques like TF-IDF.

### 2. Cosine similarity is calculated between movie vectors to find the most similar movies.

## Streamlit Web App:

### A user selects a movie or searches for it using the web app. The app processes the input and displays a list of similar movies.

## Tech Stack---

### Python: Core language for data processing and machine learning.

## Libraries:

### Pandas: For data manipulation.

### Scikit-learn: For vectorization and cosine similarity computation.

### Streamlit: For creating the web interface.

### Dataset: A CSV file containing movie metadata (titles, genres, descriptions, etc.).
